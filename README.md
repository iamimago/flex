# project flex

## idea
Flex is a continious development of different web areas in order to become a better programmer by constantly having something to do. 

Current project is implementing an AI achtung die curve game which is being played by an ai engine consisting of two itterations of a slightly different modell, which competes against each other to see which one is the best. Every viewer of the website should then have this game played for them (basically distributed computing system) served by the latest and "best" ai model.
