### Imago trade bot, using IG api

Not even sure this will work, but it's a fun project with very high potential outcome. 

If you branch, please go to IG: https://labs.ig.com/gettingstarted and set up your own trade api. I'm lazy so it's already preset into the code

Project is using npm server and a javascript neural network made by http://caza.la/synaptic/#/.


Also a whole bunch of me fucking about with random stuff unrelated to the project to learn both mongodb and nodejs better.

There's a risk i wont even use the ig api tbh, we'll see. IG api might be used for the trained ai though, but i'll probably use another api to actually fetch the data.
